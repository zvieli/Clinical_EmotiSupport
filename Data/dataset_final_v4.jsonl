{"text": "This started about a week ago when I noticed my mother was having trouble keeping up with her medication schedule. She takes five different pills every morning and evening, and with her vision issues, reading the small print on the blister pack became challenging. I remember being at her house on Tuesday morning when I saw her struggling to open the pill container because she couldn’t see the labels clearly. By Thursday, I noticed she had only taken two of her morning medications. I became increasingly concerned because she had a history of forgetting doses, but this time it felt different—more confusing and disorganized.\n\nOn Friday, I called her primary care provider to discuss the situation, and we decided to schedule a follow-up appointment for the next week to review her medications. During the call, I explained how overwhelmed she felt trying to manage everything on her own, and the doctor suggested simplifying her regimen by switching to daily pills instead of multiple daily doses. I also mentioned that her daughter, who lives with her, was helping but still finding it confusing.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, when the doctor called back with the new prescription and a referral to a medication therapy management program. They recommended using a pill organizer with larger labels and a pill dispenser with voice prompts. I immediately helped her set up the new system, which included placing her medications in labeled compartments and setting up an alarm for each dose. Now, on this Saturday afternoon, she seems much more confident, and I’ve observed her taking her medications correctly twice already. It’s been a bit of a rollercoaster, but seeing her confusion start to clear up is rewarding.", "domain": "clinical", "language": "en", "emotions": {"anxiety": 1, "confusion": 1, "frustration": 1, "anger": 0, "disappointment": 0, "satisfaction": 0}, "id": 613}
